<%= @user.first_name %>,

Welcome to Unfound Sounds. You're in for a treat, and hopefully some great vinyl if you keep an eye on our monthly hints.

I'm Michael, the treasure hunt organizer. Please let me know if you have any questions, or if there are any records you'd like me to hide in the coming summer months.

The next treasure hunt will start on <%= Date.today.at_beginning_of_month.next_month.strftime("%A, %B %e") %>. You've bought in for $1.99, and will be receiving hints via email every day the treasure hunt continues in your city.

If you'd like to change your email frequency, update your profile, or refund your account, visit your profile page: <%= user_url(@user) %>.

Have fun, and happy hunting!

All the best,
Michael
