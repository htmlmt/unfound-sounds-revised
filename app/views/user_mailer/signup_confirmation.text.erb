Welcome to Unfound Sounds. You're in for a treat, and hopefully some great vinyl if you keep an eye on our hints.

I'm Michael, the treasure hunt organizer. Please let me know if you have any questions, or if there are any records you'd like me to hide in the coming summer months.

Here's how a hunt goes: Hints are posted each day starting on the 1st of each summer month, June through September, at unfoundsounds.com. Albums are hidden in local establishments, so they're available for pickup only during business or building hours.

If you find an album, please take a photo of your treasure and send it to this email: michael@unfoundsounds.com.

Have fun, and happy hunting!

All the best,
Michael
